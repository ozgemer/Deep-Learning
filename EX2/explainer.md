<h1>Deep Learning Project - Assignment #2</h1>
Fashion MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories.<br>
Our goal is to solve the problem of identifying the category of a given image. In this project we have a total of 4 models: binary classification and 3 multi-class classification with different model and trainning paramaters.

<h2>Colab notebook structure</h2>
the notebook is divided to 4 main sections<br>
1. 'import libraries' - notebook imports<br>
2. 'Neural Network with pytorch part 1' - binary classification<br>
3. 'Neural Network with pytorch part 2' - multi-class classiciation<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp a. data preprocessing (needs to be run for any model to work)<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp b. models - divided to 3: base, ex1, ex2<br>
4. 'Test Enviroment' - single prediction part

<h4>Binary Classification</h4>
Run section #1 (imports) and run the whole section of the binary classification (#2)<br>

<h4>Multi-Class Classification</h3>
Run section #1 (imports), The multi-class classification section is divided into 2 parts.<br>
part 1 is called 'Data preprocessing' and needs to be run before ANY model you wish to activate.<br>
after ruinning that section you should be able to run any/all models.

<h4>Test Enviroment - Single Prediction</h4>
To test the saved model from part 2 of the assignment (multi-class classifcation) you just need to run the whole section which is divided to: <br>imports, loading the best model, uploading an image and predicting it.
